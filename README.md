# Customer satellites launched by ISRO (1999-2022)

In this project we create choropleth map of the world where we plot the number of satellites that the ISRO has launched for a country. The dataset is obtained from [here](https://www.isro.gov.in/media_isro/pdf/ForeignSatellites/381_foreign_satellites.pdf).

Our final table is reported below.
